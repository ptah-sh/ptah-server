Ptah.sh is in it's early stages of the development.

The software evolves rapidly, so that internal structure changes a lot week after week.

With this in mind, we currently accept code contributions only for the following reasons:

-   Documentation improvements
-   Tickets marked as `help wanted`
-   Tickets marked as `good first issue`
-   Tickets marked as `1-click` on the [ptah-sh.github.io](https://github.com/ptah-sh/ptah-sh.github.io) repo

If you would like to support Ptah.sh development, please feel free to create guides, screencasts, contribute on forums or donate a small amount via GitHub Sponsors or by subscribing to the Cloud option of the service.
