# Not under active development

Docker Swarm shown itself to be a very unstable and unreliable solution for the deployment of the Ptah.sh platform.

This lead to the decision to move away from Docker Swarm and to use Kubernetes (/hand-crafted orchestrator) as the underlying technology for the Ptah.sh platform.

As this is going to be a big change, I'm archiving the project for now.

If you would like to help with the development, please file a ticket.

## About Ptah.sh

Ptah.sh is a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) self-hosting deployment platform - alternative to Heroku/Vercel and other Big Corp software. We believe that indie, startups and small to medium businesses must not suffer from unpredicted billing or bare-metal/VPS configurations.

The service is built on top of the proven container management solution - Docker Swarm.

Ptah.sh takes the pain out of deployment by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:

-   Setting up stateful services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL and others).
-   Scaling stateless services to an infinite number of nodes (servers, as much as Docker Swarm can do).
-   Managing automated backups for critical data.
-   Load balancing of an incoming traffic and SSL auto-provisioning via Caddy Server.
-   And many more features.

## Components

Ptah.sh is a collection of several interdependent services:

-   [Ptah.sh Server](https://github.com/ptah-sh/ptah-server) - the core of the platform, responsible for managing the infrastructure, scaling, and load balancing.
-   [Ptah.sh Agent](https://github.com/ptah-sh/ptah-agent) - the component installed on the target machine, responsible for running the containers and services.
-   [Ptah.sh Caddy](https://github.com/ptah-sh/ptah-caddy) - the component installed on the target machine, responsible for running the Caddy Server and providing metrics to the Ptah.sh Server.
-   [Ptah.sh GitHub Action](https://github.com/ptah-sh/deploy-action) - the component responsible for deploying the application to the target machine.
-   [Ptah.sh Website](https://github.com/ptah-sh/ptah-sh.github.io) - the website of the Ptah.sh platform available at [ptah.sh](https://ptah.sh), containing the documentation, 1-Click Apps templates and the public-facing information.
