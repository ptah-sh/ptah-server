## About Ptah.sh

Ptah.sh is a [Fair Source](https://fair.io/) self-hosting deployment platform - alternative to Heroku/Vercel and other Big Corp software. We believe that indie, startups and small to medium businesses must not suffer from unpredicted billing or bare-metal/VPS configurations.

The service is built on top of the proven container management solution - Docker Swarm.

Ptah.sh takes the pain out of deployment by easing common tasks used in many projects, such as:

-   Setting up stateful services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL and others).
-   Scaling stateless services to an infinite number of nodes (servers, as much as Docker Swarm can do).
-   Managing automated backups for critical data.
-   Load balancing of an incoming traffic and SSL auto-provisioning via Caddy Server.
-   And many more features.
